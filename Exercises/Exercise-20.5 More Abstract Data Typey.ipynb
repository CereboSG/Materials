    "Using a stack data structure, write a function `solver(expr)` that takes in a string of a mathematical expression `expr` such as `((1*7)+6)` and returns `13`. You may assume that the entire expression would never have spaces, and would always be enclosed in an opening and closing parenthesis `( )`. Do not use the built-in function `eval()`. Test your function with `solver(\"((1*7)+6)\")` and show your output. <div style=\"text-align: right\">[6]</div>"
