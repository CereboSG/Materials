    "Routines (also called subroutines or subprograms) correspond to self-contained blocks of statements that are given identifiers (i.e., names) and can be called from different parts of the program code. In the following example of a routine in Python, line 2 and line 3 are the blocks of statements and the identifier is `hello`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 def hello():\n",
    "2    x=input('Please enter your name:')\n",

    "A routine may either correspond to a function or a procedure. A procedure corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and can be called to perform a sub-task; procedures **do not return any values** to the code that called it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and **returns a single value**; a function call must be part of an expression (since it returns a value).\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4.1.1 Declaring and Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a procedure or function, we must first declare it. A routine declaration consists of a routine interface (i.e., routine header) followed by a routine body. The routine body is the statement block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example in pseudocode. \n",
    "\n",
    "```coffeescript\n",
    "1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",
    "2    DECLARE result : INTEGER\n",
    "3    result ← n * n\n",
    "4    RETURN result\n",
    "5 ENDFUNCTION\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above example, we notice that the routine interface (or more specifically, the function interface since the above example is corresponds to a function) includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The identifier or name of the function (i.e., `square`)\n",
    "- The parameter(s) (i.e., input variable(s)) for the function (i.e., the single input variable `n : INTEGER`)\n",
    "- The data type of the `result` to be returned (i.e., the last `INTEGER` on the first line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Correspondingly, the function body contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The various statements that define what the function does (i.e., each line after the function header/interface)\n",
    "- A statement that gives the function a value to return (i.e., the “return result” statement on the last line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, when we define a routine that requires values to be passed to the routine body, we use an ordered list of variables, termed **parameters**, in the routine interface. E.g., `n` is a parameter in the example above. \n",
    "When the routine is called with an actual input, the input is called an **argument**, i.e., the arguments supplied are assigned to the corresponding parameter of the routine. Do note the order of the parameters in the parameter list must be the same as the order in the list of arguments. Using our example above, in the expression `square(2)`, `2` is the argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an executed program gets to the statement that includes a function call as part of the expression, the function is executed. The value returned from this function call is then used in the expression. Thus, with the above line of code, the result of the `square(2)` function call is assigned to the variable `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do remember that only functions have return values. Thus, when a procedure is called, it does not form part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a routine does not include any parameters, we simply specify an empty set of parentheses `()` instead. The following is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```coffeescript\n",
    "1 FUNCTION get_integer(): INTEGER\n",
    "2    INPUT “Input an integer value:” value\n",
    "3    RETURN value\n",
    "4 ENDFUNCTION\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above function may be called using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```coffeescript\n",
    "int_input ← get_integer()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in both the function interface and the call to the function, only `()` is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a routine requires one or more values from the main program, these are supplied as **arguments** to the subroutine at the time it is called. "
