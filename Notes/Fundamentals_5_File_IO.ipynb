    "# 5.1 Opening and Writing Files\n",
    "Python has a built-in function `open(file_path)` to open a file. The `open()` function returns a `file` *object*, also called a file handler, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `file_path` in `open()` can be a relative or absolute path. \n",
    "* If only file name is specified, Python assume the file is in the same folder as current Python kernel\n",
    "* When specifying full path, use `/` instead of `\\`, which is used as escape character in string\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent further read and write on the opened file, we need to close a file object using the `close()` method.\n",

If the read hits EOF (End of File) before obtaining `no_of_char` characters, then it reads only available ones. Without this argument, it will read till EOF. Syntax is\n",
