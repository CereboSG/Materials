    "2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides a communication service at an intermediate level between an application program and the Internet Protocol. TCP is responsible for routing application protocols to the correct application on the destination computer. To accomplish this, port numbers are used. Ports can be thought of as seperate channels on each computer. For example, you can surf the web while reading e-mail in the middle of a Zoom call with Genshin Impact open in a window. This is because these these applications used different port numbers. When a packet arrives at a computer and makes its way up the protocol stack, the TCP layer decides which application receives the packet based on a port number.
