Therefore, it can be difficult to support the processing of unstructured data using relational databases compared to NoSQL databases.\n",

Vertically scalable means that improving the performance of a relational database server usually requires upgrading an existing server with faster processors and more memory. Such high-performance components can be expensive and upgrades are limited by the capacity of a single machine. On the other hand, horizontally scalable means that the performance of a NoSQL database can be improved by simply increasing the number of servers. This is relatively cheaper as mass-produced average-performance computers are easily available at low prices.\n",
