    "\n",
    "Recall from Exercise 1.2, an **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence of real numbers \n",
    "$$u_1,u_2,\\cdots, u_n$$\n",
    "such that the difference between two consecutive terms is constant, i.e. $u_{n+1}-u_n=d$ for some constant $d\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $d\\neq 0$, called the **common difference** and $n\\geq 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sequence $2,5,8,11,14,\\dots$ is an arithmetic sequence with first term $2$ and common difference $3$.\n",
