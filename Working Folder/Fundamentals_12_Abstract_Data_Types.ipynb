    "# 10.0 Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.  This is analogous to an algebraic structure in mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, integers are an ADT, defined as the values ..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ..., and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for integer division), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer. Explicitly, \"behavior\" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition, etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This mathematical model contrasts with **data structures**, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically integers are represented in a data structure as binary numbers, most often as two's complement, but might be binary-coded decimal or in ones' complement, but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, **Abstract Data Type** (ADT): \n",
    "- specifies interactions/operations of the objects of the data type. \n",
    "- has no code. It is not the actual implementation.\n",
    "- often has more than one way to be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **Data Structure** (DS) is the actual representation of the data and the algorithms to manipulate the data elements. i.e concrete implementation of a ADT. Also, one allowable operation in ADT is one function implemented in the associated DS.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the **main advantage of ADT** is that users only need to understand the allowable operations of an ADT before using it. No knowledge of actual implementation is required.\n"
