    "- Rows are unique, i.e no repeated rows\r\n",

    "- A **primary key** is a candidate key that is most appropriate to become the main key for a table. It uniquely identifies each record in a table. It is a special case of the candidate key. It is used to uniquely identify a record or row in a table. In the table description, the primary key is denoted with an underline on the attribute, e.g. $$\\text{Student}\\left(\\underline{\\text{MatricNo}},\\text{ Name, Gender, CivicsClass}\\right)$$\r\n",
    "- A **secondary key** is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key, i.e. an alternative to the primary key. A user often wants to search the database using the secondary key. However, it is up to the designer of the database which of the attributes will form the secondary key. The setting up of these secondary keys is called *indexing*. \r\n",
    "- A **composite key** is a combination of two or more fields in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each record in a table. Uniqueness is only guaranteed when the fields are combined.\r\n",
