    "# 15.4 Methods of Communication in a Network\n",
    "There are two methods of communication in a network, they are **packet switching** and **circuit switching**.\n",
    "- **Packet switching** is a method of data transmission where data is grouped into smaller chunks called **packets** before being transmitted over a digital network. You can think of a packet as an envelope in the postal system, they’re labelled with addresses for their sender and recipient and contain information intended for the recipient. In a network using packet switching, one message is frequently split into multiple packets, each of which is sent to its recipient via the best possible route before being reassembled with other packets by its recipient. \n",
    "\n",
    "    When a packet is sent through a network, it usually has to pass through a number of hardware devices called **routers** before reaching its destination. A router uses the recipient address on a packet to determine where to send the packet. Every time that a packet passes through a router, we call it a **hop**. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Each packet can only pass through a finite number of hops. A packet’s **time to live** (or TTL) is a number that indicates how many hops the packet can partake in and is reduced by one with each hop. When a packet’s TTL expires, the packet is said to be **dropped**, meaning that the packet is **deleted**. The recipient will notice a missing packet and request that the sender transmits the missing packet again. \n",

    "    |Packet contents| Where the packet holds the data that is being transferred. |\n",
    "    |Time to live (TTL)| Holds the number of hops a packet can go through before being dropped.|\n",
    "    |Sequence number | Contains the number of packets in a message and identifies a packet’s position in relation to others. This allows packets to be reassembled in the correct order and allows missing packets to be identified.\n",

    "- A **switch** is a hardware that connects multiple networked devices in the network. It maintains an address table containing an unique identifier for each device connected to it, called **Media Access Control (MAC)** addresses. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. In other words, a switch connects multiple devices to create a network.\n",

    "- facilitates the user to use the services of the network.\n",
    "- used to develop network-based applications.\n",
    "- provides user services like user login, naming network devices, formatting messages, and e-mails, transfer of files etc.\n",
    "- concerned with error handling and recovery of the message as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer uses a number of protocols, the main among which are as follows:\n",
    "- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP)** − It is the underlying protocol for world wide web. It defines how hypermedia messages are formatted and transmitted.\n",
    "- **File Transfer Protocol(FTP)** − It is a client-server based protocol for transfer of files between client and server over the network. In particular, it handles the case when the end-systems have different operating systems with different file systems. \n",
    "- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol(SMTP)** − It lays down the rules and semantics for sending emails. As more emails are now web-based, SMTP has largely been replaced by HTTP to access the email application.\n",
    "- **Post Office Protocal version 3(POP3)** and **Internet Message Access Protocol(IMAP)** are both protocols to receive emails. The distinction is the location for which the emails reside, for POP3, the emails are downloaded to the client computer whereas for IMAP, the emails aren't downloaded but kept on the server while being accessible from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layer 4. Transport Layer \n",
    "The functions of the transport layer are:\n",
    "- to ensure error-free, end-to-end delivery of data from the source host to the destination host\n",
    "- to carry out error checking, flow control, and verification for reliable connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer uses a number of protocols, the main among which are as follows:\n",
    "- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** − It is a reliable connection-oriented protocol that transmits data from the source to the destination machine without any error. A connection is established between the peer entities prior to transmission. \n",
    "    - At the sending host, TCP divides an incoming byte stream into segments and assigns a separate sequence number to each segment. TCP also manages flow control so that a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver. \n",
    "    - At the receiving host, TCP reorders the segments and sends an acknowledgment to the sender for correct receipt of segments. \n",
    "    - TCP has to ensure that any response is directed back to the application protocol. \n",
    "    E.g., World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV are both MMORPGs that uses TCP mainly.\n",
    "- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** − It is a message-oriented protocol that provides a simple unreliable, connectionless, unacknowledged service. It is suitable for applications that do not require TCP’s sequencing, error control or flow control. It is used for transmitting a small amount of data where the speed of delivery is more important than the accuracy of delivery. For example, real-time connections like video streaming, VoIP, and FPS games like Overwatch and CS:GO uses UDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layer 3 Network Layer\n",
    "The function of the network layer is to ensure correct routing over the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main protocol used in this layer is Internet Protocol(IP). The protocol takes the packet received from the transport layer and adds a further header. The header contains IP addresses of both send and the receiver. To find the IP address,the DNS service to find the address corresponding to the URL supplied in the user data is likely to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The packet created by IP is termed **datagram** which is then to sent to the next layer, **Data Link** Layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Layer 2 Data Link Layer\n",
    "The function of Data link layer is to convert data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware on the sendng end. At the receiving end, Data link layer picks up data from hardware which are in the form of electrical signals, assembles them in a recognizable frame format, and hands over to upper layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layer 1 Physical Layer\n",
    "Physical layer deals with the physical connectivity of two different stations. This layer defines the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies, pulses used to represent binary signals etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical layer provides its services to Data-link layer. Data-link layer hands over frames to physical layer. Physical layer converts them to electrical pulses, which represent binary data.The binary data is then sent over the wired or wireless media.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ethernet\n",
    "Ethernet is a protocol suite designed for use in a LAN operating in the data-link and physical layer. It has the following subprotocols:\n",
    "- Logical Link Control (LLC) manages data transmissions and ensures the integrity of data transmissions. It has **NO** responsibility for checking if a transmission has been successfully delivered.\n",
    "- Medium Access control (MAC) is reponsible for assembling Ethernet packets called **frames**, in which we have the address of the transmitter and the address of the receiver. Also, it initiates frame transmission and handles recovery from transmission failure due to a collioson\n",
    "- Physical Coding Layer (PCS) is responsible for coding data ready for transmission or decoding data received. It either receives a frame from the MAC protocol or sends on to it.\n",
    "- Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) is responsible for signal transmitting and receiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "# IPv4 Addressing\n",
    "To define the source and destination of data in a transmission in a computer network, **IP (Internet Protocol)** addressing is used. Currently, the Internet uses IP version 4 (IPv4) addressing. It uses 32 bit (4 bytes) where a group of bits is used to defined a network (**netID**) and another group is used to define a host on the network (**hostID**). Their aim was to assign a unique, universally recognised address for each device on the internet. \n",

    "\n",
    "To make it simpler for the user, IPv4 address are actually written in denary where the denary values for each byte is separated by dots, e.g. the IPv4 address above is displayed as `172.16.4.47`.\n",

    "# Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)\n",
    "To improve IPv4 addressing scheme, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is introduced. Similar to IPv4, it uses 32 bits to define a computer on the network and retains the netID and hostID functionality similar in the class system. However, it drops the rigidity of the class identifier and allows the split between the netID and the hostID to suit individual need. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this scheme, an additional 8-bit suffix is added to the address. This suffix specifiies the number of bits used for the netID. For example, consider the following IP address\n",

    "> `11000011000011000000011000001110/00010101`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `00010101` is 21 in denary, this means that the first 21 bits of the address is the netID and the remaining 11 bits is the hostID.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subnetting\n",
    "Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or more networks. It allows for a more efficient use of a hostID by applying a structure to it. For example, subnetting a medium-sized organisation's network of 150 employees. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the internet, all of the allocated IP addresses have netID pointing to the router. The router then has to interpret the hostID to direct the transmission to the appropriate hosts on one of the networks via a gateway.\n",

    "    - the data is transferred,\n",
    "    - the links are then removed\n",
    "    During the duration of the communication, the whole circuit is reserved only for the two end-systems to communicate. As such it is ideal for communications which require data to be transmitted in real time.\n",
    "- **packet switching**. Data from the sender end-system is broken down and packaged in portions called **packets**. Packets contain header which contains instructions for delivery, which includes IP address and sequencing information, plus the data body. Thus, in this method, there is no need to maintain a circuit for the communication. The packets can travel through any path on the network to get to the destination end-system. The advantage is that the nodes can optimize the available channels to find the fastest path for the packets to go to the destination. As such, different packets might arrive at different time and they need to be reassembled based on the sequencing information that they get transmitted out with from the source. \n",

    "When data is transmitted, a verication check on the data when it is received is performed called the **checksum check**. Its purpose is to detect errors that may have been introduced during its transmission.\n",

    "- locate the byte(s) designed as the **checksum byte(s)** in the transmitted data packet\n",
    "- calculate the sum of the number of values of the remaining bytes in the data packet. This sum is called the **checksum value**\n",
    "- compare **checksum value** (in binary) with the checksum byte(s). \n",
    "- if the checksum value matches with the checksum byte, we conclude that that the data packet has been successfully transmitted error. \n",

    "Assuming the data is transferrred in bytes using a seven-bit code, another alternative to verify the data received is **one-bit parity check**. For this check, there are two different parities that can be implemented:\n",

    "- similarly, **even parity** just means that the sum of bits in each transmitted bytes is an even number, i.e., the number of 1s in a byte is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we are using *even parity* check, we have the following procedure.\n",
    "1. At the transmitting end, the number of 1s in the seven-bit code is counted.\n",
    "2. If the count gives an even number, the last bit in the byte, termed the **parity bit** is set to 0. Else, the parity bit is set to 1.\n",
