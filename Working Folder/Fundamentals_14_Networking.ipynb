    "In a network, the specification on how the various devices n the network are connected are called a **topology**. The following are the different topologies:\n",
    "- **Bus topology**: the network contains *one shared link* to which all devices are attached.\n",

    "- **Star topology**: each end-system in the network is *linked to a central device*\n",

    "\n",
    "Example of circumstances where client-server approach is used:\n",
    "- the server stores a database which is accessed from the client system.\n",
    "- the server stores a web application which allows the client system to find or, sometimes, supply information\n",
    "- the server stores a web application which allows the client system to carry out an e-commerce or financial transaction\n",

    "A communication **protocol** is a set of rules for data transmission which are agreed by sender and receiver so that the data is correctly transmitted. It allows devices to identify and make connections with each other, as well as formatting rules that specify how data is packaged into messages sent and received. The absence of this protocol could cause unwanted behaviours. For example, without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, could be sending its data in 8-bit segments while the receiving computer might expect the data in 16-bit segments, and thus, receiving computer will read the information wrongly.\n",

    "# IPv4 Addressing\n",
    "To define the source and destination of data in a transmission in a computer network, **IP (Internet Protocol)** addressing is used. Currently, the Internet uses IP version 4 (IPv4) addressing. It uses 32 bit (4 bytes) where a group of bits is used to defined a network (**netID**) and another group is used to define a host on the network (**hostID**). Their aim was to assign a unique, universally recognised address for each device on the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the scheme, different entities are categorized into different classes (A to E). Different classes allows for different number of unique hostIDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Class Identifier (first bits in the first byte) | Number of bits for netID | Number of bits for hostID |\n",
    "|-------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| A     | 0                                               | 7                        | 24                        |\n",
    "| B     | 10                                              | 14                       | 16                        |\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, `10101100 00010000 00000100 00101111` is an IPv4 address. Since the first 2 bits in the first octet is `10`, it means that the host resides in a class B network. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it simpler for the user, IPv4 address are actually written in denary where the denary values for each byte is separated by dots, e.g. the IPv4 address above is displayed as `172.16.4.47`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qn: What is the obvious limitation of the IPv4 system? Hint: Think about how many unique IDs can each class have.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)\n",
    "To improve IPv4 addressing scheme, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is introduced. Similar to IPv4, it uses 32 bits to define a computer on the network and retains the netID and hostID functionality similar in the class system. However, it drops the rigidity of the class identifier and allows the split between the netID and the hostID to suit individual need. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this scheme, an additional 8-bit suffix is added to the address. This suffix specifiies the number of bits used for the netID. For example, consider the following IP address\n",

    "> `11000011000011000000011000001110/00010101`\n",

    "Since `00010101` is 21 in denary, this means that the first 21 bits of the address is the netID and the remaining 11 bits is the hostID.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subnetting\n",
    "Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or more networks. It allows for a more efficient use of a hostID by applying a structure to it. For example, subnetting a medium-sized organisation's network of 150 employees. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the internet, all of the allocated IP addresses have netID pointing to the router. The router then has to interpret the hostID to direct the transmission to the appropriate hosts on one of the networks via a gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Network Address Translation (NAT)\n",
    "\n",
    "For end-systems to communicate over internet, there are two possible methods or approaches:\n",
    "- **circuit switching**. End-systems are connected to local exchanges with a switching function. These local exchanges are also connected to each other via number of intermediate nodes with a switching function. \n",
    "    The following steps take place for a data transfer to happen:\n",
    "    - the sender provides the identity of the intended receiver,\n",
    "    - the system checks if the receiver is ready to accept data,\n",
    "    - if the receiver is available, a sequence of links is established across the network. This dedicated physical, communications channel is what is termed a **circuit**\n",
    "    - the data is transferred,\n",
    "    - the links are then removed\n",
    "    During the duration of the communication, the whole circuit is reserved only for the two end-systems to communicate. As such it is ideal for communications which require data to be transmitted in real time.\n",
    "- **packet switching**. Data from the sender end-system is brokend down and packaged in portions called **packets**. Packets contain header which contains instructions for delivery, which includes IP address and sequencing information, plus the data body. Thus, in this method, there is no need to maintain a circuit for the communication. The packets can travel through any path on the network to get to the destination end-system. The advantage is that the nodes can optimize the available channels to find the fastest path for the packets to go to the destination. As such, different packets might arrive at different time and they need to be reassembled based on the sequencing information that they get transmitted out with from the source. "
